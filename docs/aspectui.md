# User Interface documentation

## Map View
The screenshot below shows the most prominent features of the user interface. Most of the screen space is filled by the spectra map. It is composed of icons represenenting downscaled [SDSS](http://sdss3.org) spectra. Left of the map can be found a tool to import and export data sets which would be highlighted in the map. Above the map a tool for coordinate input allows to jump to a certain point in the Kohonen Map.

## Basic use
The user interface is a web application making use of software intended to create responsive streetmaps like for instance [Openstreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org). Thus it allows similar interactions. 

### Panning
Use your mouse to pan the map around. To this end click and hold down your left mouse button somewhere on the spectra map and move your mouse. As an Alternative use your keyboards arrow keys to move the map around.

### Zooming
There are several ways to zoom in and out of the spectra map. You can click the Plus and Minus buttons on the top left of the spectra area to zoom in and out. Also, turning mousewheel or using your touchpad's scroll function with the mouse cursor over the spectra area will trigger the change of zoom level.

### Add and remove Layers
There is a collapsed layer menu on the top right of the spectra area. It allows you to add and remove more layers to the map view. For example you could have a color coded layer for the red shift of your spectra objects.
