# Whish list, i.e. features to come in future

## Context menu

A context menu on right button mouse click with:
- show/don't show spec icons of already inspected (i.e. clicked) objects
- show/don't show spec icons of objects in selection layer


## Marker for objects inspected at explorer

This could be a letter, a cross or a colored margin around the spectrum.

## Other User inteface improvements
- in selections don't collect empty neurons


## Save/Load button to save and restore the whole work space for later use

The workspace is completely stored in browser. When the site is reloaded all data is lost. It is already possible to export and later reimport selection layers. However, to proceed at a later time it would be convenient to save and restore the state of the whole workspace at once.
