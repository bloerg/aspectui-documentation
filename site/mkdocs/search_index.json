Most of the screen space is filled by the spectra map. It is composed of icons represenenting downscaled \nSDSS\n spectra. Left of the map can be found a tool to import and export data sets which would be highlighted in the map. Above the map a tool for coordinate input allows to jump to a certain point in the Kohonen Map.\n\n\n\n\nbasic use\n\n\nThe user interface is a web application making use of software intended to create responsive streetmaps like for instance \nOpenstreetmap\n. Thus it allows similar interactions. \n\n\npanning\n\n\nUse your mouse to pan the map around. To this end click and hold down your left mouse button somewhere on the spectra map and move your mouse. As an Alternative use your keyboards arrow keys to move the map around.\n\n\n\n\nzooming\n\n\nThere are several ways to zoom in and out of the spectra map. You can click the Plus and Minus buttons on the top left of the spectra area to zoom in and out. Also, turning mousewheel or using your touchpad's scroll function with the mouse cursor over the spectra area will trigger the change of zoom level.\n\n\n\n\nadd and remove layers\n\n\nThere is a collapsed layer menu on the top right of the spectra area. It allows you to add and remove more layers to the map view. For example you could have a color coded layer for the red shift of your spectra objects.\n\n\n\n\nchanging colors\n\n\nIf in the upper right layer menu the \ncolored background\n layer is selected, you can change colors of the spec icons and their background. To this end type colors in \nhexadecimal notation\n or just use color words like \nred\n, \ngreen\n, \nblack\n etc. Also, there is a nice \ncolor picker\n giving you the hexademical values.\n\n\n\n\nworking with the map\n\n\nInspect objects at the SDSS\n\n\nClicking on a spec icon in the map opens a popup with extra information regarding the clicked object. There can be different data in the popup, however there is at least the link to the \nSDSS Explorer\n homepage of the corresponding object. If you are looking for a detailed spectrum and metadata this is the place to go.\n\n\nClicking on the Explorer link adds the clicked icon to the user defined layer \nExplorer Click\n. On activation of this layer in the top right layer menu will blend in the string \"explored\" on the clicked spec icons.\n\n\n\n\nselect objects for later export\n\n\nOn the upper left of the spectra area, below the Plus/Minus zoom control you can find areal and single object selection tools. Use them to make sets of interesting objects for later export or illustration of object positions in the map. \n\n\nThe objects you select are stored in \nuser selection layers\n. There is alway one such layer named \ndefault\n. As soon as you switch it on in the layer control menu in the upper right of the spectra area, you can start to select objects. You will see, that they are indicated with color overlay immediately. \n\n\nTo export the objects coordinates in the Kohonen Map and the relevant SDSS ids (\nMJD\n, \nplate id\n, \nfiber id\n) click the export button of the according user selection layer left of the spectra area.\n\n\nDepending on the number of objects in the layer export can take a while. \n\n\nAn export should look similar to this:\n\n\nsom_x,som_y,mjd,plateid,fiberid\n16,17,56072,6014,634\n16,18,55856,4289,816\n16,19,56046,5173,782\n16,20,56243,6377,676\n17,17,53499,2011,310\n17,18,56365,6629,862\n17,19,55654,3961,714\n17,20,56413,6669,462\n18,17,56448,7030,516\n18,18,56576,7055,966\n18,19,55803,5062,98\n18,20,55681,4704,84\n19,17,56749,7376,997\n19,18,56662,7337,626\n19,19,56566,7137,906\n19,20,56046,5173,883\n\n\n\n\nadd more user defined layers\n\n\nYou can add more user defined layers. You would want to do this for example if you needed to distinguish between two selections by color or to keep different types of objects apart.\n\n\nTo add a new layer click \nadd layer\n on the left side. You will be asked for a \nlayer name\n, which can be descriptive like \nInteresting Objects of Type 1\n or short like \nother\n. Also you can set a color for the indication of selected objects. Use either color words like \nred\n, \nblack\n, \ngreen\n and so on or \nhtml colors in hexadecimal notation\n. Also, there is a nice \ncolor picker\n giving you the hexademical values.\n\n\nOnce you have added the new layer, and you probably want to do two things:\n1. Add the layer as overlay to the map by activating it in the layer menu in the upper right of the spectra area.\n2. Activate the layer as target for selected objects, by clicking it on the left hand side in the list of available layers.\n\n\nThen start to add objects to the newly created layer by using the selection tools in the upper left of the spectra map.\n\n\ncolor overlay\n\n\nASPECT-ui allows to import csv-data as layers. Just prepare a \ncsv\n data set. It has to have headers with at least x and y coordinates in the Kohonen Map space or \nMJD\n, \nplate id\n, \nfiber id\n. \n\n\nThe expected names of the csv fields are \nsom_x\n for the x coordinate in the Kohonen Map, \nsom_y\n for the y coordinate, \nmjd\n for SDSS MJD, \nplateid\n for SDSS plate id and \nfiberid\n for SDSS fiber id.\n\n\nSo your import csv data could look like:\n\n\nsom_x,som_y\n0,0\n100,100\n13,234\n\n\n\n\nWhich would lead to marked objects at the given coordinates. \n\n\nIf you don't know x and y coordinates but \nMJD\n, \nplate id\n and \nfiber id\n, you can also import data like:\n\n\nmjd,plateid,fiberid\n56072,6014,634\n55856,4289,816\n56046,5173,782\n56243,6377,676\n\n\n\n\nThe software of the user interface will try to map the ids to spectra in the Kohonen Map.
